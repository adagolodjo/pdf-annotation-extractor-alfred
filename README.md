An [Alfred Workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/) to extract annotations as Markdown & insert Pandoc Citations as References.

Automatically determines correct page numbers, merges highlights across page breaks, prepends a YAML Header bibliographic information, and some more small Quality-of-Life conveniences.

## ⚠️ Deprecation
This workflow has been archived. You can use the successor, [PDF Annotation Extractor](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/pdf-annotation-extractor), which offers roughly the same functionality, but works without Alfred.
