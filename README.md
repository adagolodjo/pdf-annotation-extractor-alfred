# PDF Annotation Extractor
Alfred Workflow that does pretty much what the name says.

## Requirements
- Alfred (üçèÔ∏è only)
- [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/shop/) (~30‚Ç¨)

## Installation
1) Check if Python3 (version 3.9) and Pip are installed on your machine: 
```
python3 --version
python3 -m pip3 --version
```
2) If not, install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) and [Pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py). You can do so with this code:
```
# first line assumes you have Homebrew. if not, install python3 manually: https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/
brew install python3
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
```

3) Install pdfannots and its dependencies via this line:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisgrieser/pdf-annotation-extractor-alfred/main/install.sh | bash
```
4) Install the [PDF Annotation Extractor Workflow](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/pdf-annotation-extractor-alfred/releases/latest/).

5) *(optional ‚Äì in case you want the annotations as PDF file)* Install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) and a [PDF engine](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--pdf-engine) of your choice, e.g. [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).

```
# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
```
# assuming you have Homebrew
brew install pandoc
brew install wkhtmltopdf
```

## How to use
- Use the **hotkey** in when you have a PDF selected in Finder, or the currently open document in Preview or PDF Expert. The hotkey can be set in Alfred by doubleclicking the respective field at the top left.(When you are familiar with Alfred, you can also use file filter or a file search with the keyword `anno`).
- Automatically **merge highlights that span two pages**: give the highlight on the next page *exactly* the comment `cont` and they two highlights will be merge. The comment from the first highlgiht will be preserved and the reference will be corrected to include two pages, e.g. `Pohl 2018: **13-14**`
- Use the Alfred keyword `aconf` to set up output style, reference insertion, and (optionally) pdf engine.
  - output styles: Markdown file, PDF (Pandoc & PDF Engine needed), Markdown specifically for [Notion.so Toggled Lists](https://www.notion.so/Toggles-c720af26b4bd4789b736c140b2dc73fe).
  - reference insertion: The workflow inserts the references (e.g. Grieser 2019: 24). You either tell the Annotation Extractor manually which Reference to insert, or it will automatically determine the correct reference from the filename of your pdf. For that, it must be formatted as `"authors_year_[...].pdf"`. You can use bibliography management software to name your papers automatically like that.

- Right now, this workflow **only extracts free comments and highlights with comments**. More in the future (this workflow has automatic updates).


## Troubleshooting 
- This workflow won't work with annotations that are not actually saved in the PDF file. Some PDF Readers like **Skim** so this, but you can [tell them to save the notes in the actual PDF.](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/manual/SkimHelp_45.html)
- The workflow sometimes does not work when the pdf contains bigger free-form annotations (e.g. by using a stylus on a tablet to). Delete all annotations that are "image" or "free form" and the workflow should work again.
- Do not use backticks (`` ` ``) in any type of comment as this will break the annotation extraction.
- When the hotkey does not work in Preview, most likely the Alfred app does not have permissions to access Preview. You can give Alfred permission in the Mac OS System Settings.

This workflow was created by [Chris Grieser](https://chris-grieser.de/). Thanks to [Andrew Baumann for his python script 'pdfannots'](https://github.com/0xabu/pdfannots), which is basically the whole backend of this workflow.
